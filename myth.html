        <h2>Oakenshield shall rise to glory yet again.</h2>
        <p>There once were distant and fertile lands of the East, where the sun was rising and stories began to be told. Our ancestors discovered this paradise and began to cultivate wheat, chop the wood, and tame nature. There, in the cradle of civilization, we sang and danced, building brick by brick the mighty nation that we are now. But once a catastrophe emerged—the rivers were drying up, the crops did not sprout. So we decided to leave. Leaving our promised land behind, we swore it was for good, crying on each other's shoulders. Endless obstacles we faced only made our bonds stronger. We went there, where trees block the sun and mountains mourn. The Divine sent us a message that turned into a flame that is the one that burns inside us. This flame is our power and spirit of our nation; until it fades away, we are almighty. We settled in the forest, surrounded by barbarians that only worried about their own good and knew no true meaning of a family and a nation. With us came the light of civilization. We slowly began to rebuild our country—we learned how to mine and established a trade with people around us. But in the moment of weakness, the city folks came over to us. They tortured our people with unfair payments and oppressive policies. But they underestimated the unity of our nation and the sacrifice that any of us is ready to make for the good of others. We came together and slayed the enemy, returning justice and freedom, making them crawl away in fear and anger. Time flows, eras are changing, but the fire keeps burning and Oakenshield remains great. And this will last until the end of time.</p>
